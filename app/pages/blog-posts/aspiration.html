    <h1 class="blog-title">What I'd Like To Do</h1>
    <p class="blog-text">I've been taking a lot of courses on Udemy recently, and one of them, Seth Godin's Freelancer
      Course asks you to post some of your answers to the assignments online. Here's my response to one of his sample
      assignment prompts, specifically “What do you want to do?”.</p>
    <p class="blog-text">I'd like to get to a point where I can build and monetize my own applications, while offering
      services to show others how to do the same thing.</p>
    <p class="blog-text">My time as a professional software engineer has taught me a lot about core backend engineering
      principles, I've played a direct role in flexible API design, helping make architectural decisions, designing
      containerized deployment strategies on Mesos, and generally writing clean code with test coverage.</p>
    <p class="blog-text">What I've been missing and really eager to know more about is everything else, the entirely
      different world of front end development, product ideation in the first place, market research in figuring out how
      to talk to customers and designing something they actually want, crafting a delightful user experience. I've been
      filling out these gaps through online educational resources, Udacity and Udemy have been incredibly useful in
      continuing my education after college.</p>
    <p class="blog-text">Ultimately, my hope is to become knowledgeable of most aspects of an entire product design
      lifecycle, with an expertise in the technical aspects of product creation. I'd like to use this knowledge to bring
      to life amazing applications, while also sharing the lessons I learn along the way.</p>
