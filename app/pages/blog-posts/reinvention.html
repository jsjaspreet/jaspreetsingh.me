      <h1 class="blog-title">30 Days of Reinvention</h1>
      <iframe class="blog-media" width="600" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XL9528Gohe0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p class="blog-text">If you haven’t heard Earl Nightingale’s Strangest Secret, you should take a half hour out of your day to listen to him above. His call to spend your next 30 days in earnest conscious pursuit of your goals is simple but powerful if you take the message to heart. </p>
      <p class="blog-text">In the past, I’ve tried multiple times to “reinvent” myself, to replace bad habits with better ones and I’ve consistently failed to sustain the willpower to continue that journey after a couple weeks of trying. I realize I had the wrong mindset in previous attempts to see through a 30 day challenge. My approach was rooted in the impatient desire to see results rather than cultivating the discipline to adhere to a system of continuous improvement. I recently successfully completed 30 consecutive days of self-improvement and I’d like to share some of the strategies and tools I used to stay focused.</p>
      <h2 class="blog-heading">Meditation</h2>
      <p class="blog-text">Meditation has been the pillar driving 100% of my forward progress this last month.</p>
      <p class="blog-text">Meditation brings a greater self-awareness not just during the exercise, but throughout your life. For me personally, meditating as little as 10 minutes a day has allowed me to catch myself as soon as I start thinking in negative terms. I’ve also noticed I’ve gained much stronger impulse control, allowing me to keep my long-term goals in mind and suppress short-minded activities like late-night snacking or making snarky comments during office meetings. I’ve meditated in the past, but for this 30 day journey I wanted to spend time to learn proper techniques of meditation. Two resources became instrumental in keeping the habit going, Headspace and a book titled Mindfulness in Plain English. Headspace is an app that offers guided meditation free for 10 days and after that you can pay to subscribe to an entire library of topic-oriented meditation sessions. I had never tried guided meditation before but the techniques shown worked well for me and I’m proud to say I’ve meditated thirty days straight with the help of Headspace. One great feature of the app has been the flexibility to choose session-length, before you meditate you can select a range between 10-20 minutes so you can adapt the meditation practice to your schedule for the day. While Headspace has been great as a practical plan to implement a daily meditation goal, reading Mindfulness in Plain English has also offered more on the general theory and basic introduction to meditation. Together, these resources have helped me remain cognizant of my goals in the present moment.</p>

      <h2 class="blog-heading">Physical Health</h2>
      <p class="blog-text">Cultivating my physical health has been 100% in making forward progress in my goals. For these past 30 days, this has meant working out with discipline, keeping track of proper nutrition, and giving myself 8-9 hours of sleep every day to allow myself to rise early and still feel refreshed every morning.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-text">I’m sure many people can relate to working out for years and not really meeting your physical goals, or perhaps working out without goals at all but still working just for the sake of “being fit”. Before I started this goal, similar to meditation, I wanted to take the time to properly understand nutrition and how to work out to optimize my efforts in the gym. My research led me to a book called Bigger Leaner Stronger. This book breaks down everything workout-related, from nutrition to mindset to which exercises to focus on (compound exercises, compound exercises, compound exercises!). I’m on week 4 of the program now (I spent the first week of my 30 day journey just reading the book carefully before implementing it), and this sounds cliche but I’m already in the best shape of my life right now. I’ve been lifting well beyond my previous maximums, and every workout has left me feeling energized and pumped for the rest of the day, rather than the exhausting multiple hour long lifting sessions and boring steady state treadmill runs I used to do in the past.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-text">Nutrition and sleep have played a strong part for this goal too, I’ve only put quality food into my system this past month and I’m not surprised that I’ve seen only quality results. Sleep has been important not only for sustaining physical health, but also sustaining my mental health while I’ve brought these new behaviors into my life. To help quantify my sleep goals, I’ve been using this app called Sleep Cycle that monitors your breathing while you sleep and attempts to wake you up at an optimal time where you’re not in deep REM sleep. This has prevented those sorts of morning where you sleep a lot but wake up feeling groggy because you awoke close to or during your deep REM sleep.

      <p class="blog-heading">Precommitment</p>
      <p class="blog-text">Precommitment has been the most important thing driving 100% of my positivity these past few weeks.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-text">Before I talk about what precommitment is, I’d like to ask you a couple questions.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-text">Do you have any situation in your life that you know has a high potential to bring out the worst aspects of you? </p>
      <p class="blog-text">Are there people in your life, even people that you would consider “friends”, who for whatever reason you continually seem to experience unnecessary and excessive negativity around?
      </p>
      <p class="blog-text">Is there any activity in your life that has become some sort of ritualistic habit that usually ends badly for you?
      </p>
      <p class="blog-text">Precommitment for me has been all about stopping myself from getting involved in any sort of involvement that matches the above situations. This has been probably the only difficult part of my journey these past 30 days. I took a hard look at my interactions with people that matched those situations and other harmful habits I held on to and realized walking away was the best thing for me. If you’re serious about getting to the next level, don’t be afraid of being alone. Being alone has been a treasure in my life, solitude affording me clarity of thought, silence allowing me to actually listen to myself.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-heading">Conclusion</p>
      <p class="blog-text">I hope you noticed that I mentioned each goal/strategy being 100% of the driving reason behind my forward progress these past weeks. This is not a mistake, each goal is a pillar establishing the strong foundation for your dreams. When one pillar is at less than 100%, the entire structure is damaged, and soon your other pillars will deteriorate under the greater pressure too.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-text"> As Ron Swanson would say, “Don’t half-ass two things, whole ass one thing”.</p>
      <p class="blog-text">I wish you best of luck in your own 30 day journey ahead.
